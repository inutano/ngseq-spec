fastqc 2 SRA renewal!

SRA quality check project:
  let quality of NGSseq data in  Sequence Read Archive be available before downloading.
  sequence quality is calculated by FastQC (http://www.bioinformatics.bbsrc.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). Thanks Simon!
  
  calculated sequence quality can be browsed through our search&browse interface.
  NGSeq search-by-statistics service DBCLS SRAs (http://sra.dbcls.jp/).
  or my pilot project which offers better browsing interface named 鎖鋸 (http://g86.dbcls.jp/kusarinoko)
  
  this project is by Tazro Inutano Ohta in Database Center for Life Science, Japan (DBCLS).
