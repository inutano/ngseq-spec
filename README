SRA quality check project:
  Check sequence quality of public NGSeq data, Don't wasting your time by downloading wrecked sequence.
  We offer statistics of quality value of NGSseq data, which is archived Sequence Read Archive.
  Sequence quality is calculated by FastQC, one of the best qual-check software.
  Details of FastQC is here: http://www.bioinformatics.bbsrc.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/ Thanks Simon!
  
  Pre-calculated sequence quality can be browsed as a result of FastQC through our search&browse interface.
  NGSeq search-by-statistics service DBCLS SRAs (http://sra.dbcls.jp/).
  or my pilot project which offers better browsing interface named 鎖鋸 (http://g86.dbcls.jp/kusarinoko)
  
  this project is brought by Tazro Inutano Ohta, in Database Center for Life Science, Japan (DBCLS).
