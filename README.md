# SRA quality check project:

## project summary 

  Check sequence quality of public NGSeq data, Don't wasting your time by downloading wrecked sequence.
  We offer statistics of quality value of NGSseq data, which is archived Sequence Read Archive.
  Sequence quality is calculated by FastQC, one of the best qual-check software.
  Details of FastQC is here (Thanks Simon!):

## browsing progress of this project

  Pre-calculated sequence quality can be browsed as a result of FastQC through our search&browse interface.
